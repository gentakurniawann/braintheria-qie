    question: 'What is BRAIN token?',
    answer:
      'BRAIN is the native ERC-20 utility token of Braintheria, built on the QIE network. It powers the entire knowledge exchange ecosystem - used for bounties, rewards, and incentivizing quality answers. When you ask a question, you attach BRAIN as a bounty. When your answer is accepted, you earn BRAIN directly to your wallet.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do bounties work?',
    answer:
      'When you ask a question, you attach a BRAIN bounty (minimum 10 BRAIN). This bounty is locked in a smart contract - not held by Braintheria. Once you approve an answer, the contract automatically releases the bounty to the answerer. The entire flow is trustless and verifiable on-chain.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do I need crypto experience to use Braintheria?',
    answer:
      'Not at all! Sign in with Google, claim free BRAIN from the faucet, and start asking or answering questions. The complex blockchain stuff happens behind the scenes. For crypto-native users, you can connect your own wallet and track all transactions on-chain.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Which blockchain does Braintheria run on?',
    answer:
      'Braintheria runs on QIE network (Chain ID: 1983). QIE offers fast transaction speeds and low gas fees, making micro-bounties practical and affordable. All bounties, answers, and payouts are recorded on-chain for full transparency.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Is my BRAIN token safe?',
    answer:
      'Yes! Braintheria is non-custodial - we never hold your funds. When you attach a bounty, it goes into a smart contract escrow, not our wallet. Your earnings go directly to your wallet address. You maintain full control of your tokens at all times.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What happens if no one answers my question?',
    answer:
      'If your question expires without an accepted answer, you can refund your bounty back to your wallet. The smart contract ensures your BRAIN tokens are either paid to a helpful answerer or returned to you.',
